    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section XIV, we introduce Expectation-Maximization (EM) as a practical way to perform maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) even when some of the data is hidden (i.e in the presence of latent or hidden variables). To better understand EM, in this short notebook we'll explore a very simple coin-tossing example adapted from [Do and Batzoglou, Nat. Biotechnol. (2008)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1406). \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we are given two coins A and B with unkown bias $\\theta_A$ and $\\theta_B$, respectively. Our goal is to estimate the bias vector $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}= (\\theta_A, \\theta_B)$ from the outcomes of the following experiment: \n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote> \n",
    "First choose one coin at random. Then toss the selected coin 10 times independently and record the number of heads observed. Repeat this procedure 5 times.\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, let $z_i\\in\\{A,B\\}$ be the coin selected in experiment $i$ and $x_i\\in\\{0,1,\\cdots 10\\}$ be the number heads recorded by tossing $z_i$ 10 times. Since we conduct $n=5$ such experiments, we can summarize the outcomes of these 50 tosses by two vectors: $\\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,x_2\\cdots, x_5)$ and $\\boldsymbol{z}=(z_1,z_2,\\cdots, z_5)$.\n",

    " * Consider first the case where we have complete knowledge of the experiment, namely, both $\\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\\boldsymbol{z}$ are known. How would you intuitively estimate the biases of the two coins  $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}= (\\theta_A, \\theta_B)$ ?\n",

Therefore, the mean of the distribution could give us an estimate of the bias of the coin, which would be $N_H/N$(mean of a binomial distribution).\n",

Like with most optimization methods for nonconcave functions, E-M only guarantees convergence to a local maximum of the objective function. For this reason, its performance can be boosted by running the EM procedure starting with multiple initial parameters. "

    "1. When uesses drawn from an uniform distribution between [0, 1], the final answers are reasonably accurate only when the initial guess for the bias is close to the true bias. Similarly, we get the worst results for the initial guesses that are furthest away from the true biases. Out of 50000 trials, we get: <br>\n",

    "  Comparing these biases with the true biases, $p_A = 0.8$ and $p_B = 0.4$, we understand that we get the best estimates for the initial conditions that are closest to the actual values. Below, histograms are shown for the outcomes of the 50000 trials with EM and pure MLE estimators with both coins: <br>\n",

    "  For both coins, although we see some accumulation of trials near right bias ($0.8$ and $0.4$ for A and B, respectively), the distribution is pretty much flat around $\\theta$ between $0.4$ and $0.9$. Our bias estimates with EM algorithm get close to the real biases for around $\\sim 40 \\%$ of the time. But from the MLE results (bottom), we can observe that the trials are peaked at the actual biases, therefore we can conclude that pure MLE estimation performs better in general. We also observe that the results for EM algorithm is <b>worse</b> compared to the case with the fixed initial guesses.\n",
